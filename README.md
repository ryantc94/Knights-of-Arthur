# kill_the_werewolf
##Deception Game
<p> This will be based off Mafia. Basically there is a werewolf and other characters. The characters need to figure out who the werewolf is. Some characters will have special abilities. </p>
<p> TODO: Elaborate... </p>

## Architecture
I guess this can be a isomorphic app, client side for everything except the actually game itself, but I guess redux ajax can handle the client side as well... I don't know but let's get started.
### Express Backend
* ^Socket server will be in backend with WS library
### Create-React-App Frontend
* ^React Router for routing
